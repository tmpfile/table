The shell script parses all APKBUILDS in main and outputs a table with the supported architectures of each package.
This can help maintainers of an arch to more easily find out which package is still not building so he can work on that.
This script could become a cron job and be deployed on alpinelinux.org/table.html in a more beautiful format to help arch maintainers.
